## 👋 Hello!! I'm Aastha,an Electrical Engineering undergrad at IIT Jodhpur

 My interests span computer architecture, digital electronics, and operating systems, with a focus on SoC/ASIC design(RTL coding).
 💻 I'm passionate about programming in C, Python, and exploring machine learning basics, all while testing my skills in DSA. Beyond academics, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects on GitHub related to ML,DSA and RTL applications.

📚 Outside the tech realm, I'm an avid reader with a love for Indian history. Currently, I'm working on my book, hoping for a publishing deal one day (fingers crossed!)😁. Music fuels my creativity, and I'm actively involved in co-curricular activities on campus.

🚀 Let's connect for discussions on tech, books, or anything in between!
